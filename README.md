# Switch Easy System

## 1.INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Background
Changes that either relate to the components of the products or manufacturing process are always unavoidable in automobile manufacturing. The reasons may vary from problem solving to quality improvement, and from introducing new suppliers to redeploy to the production line. But the outcome is not always productive, it may even be destructive. Various steps need to be taken before the changes actually take place to make sure that these changes will help to maintain or improve the quality of the products or manufacturing process. This is a complicated process that involves numerous people, departments, and sometimes different factories. The interrelated steps in the process make it difficult to change one thing without affecting another. So the changes made will go through a critical process that should guarantee the quality of the automobile. Due to the thousands of components in a car and complicated process during manufacturing, this process is highly troublesome and onerous.

### 1.2 Motivation and Objectives
The motivation and objective of the system is to help relieve engineersâ€™ workloads, and to make the switch processes as high-efficient, low cost, and accurate as possible. To be more specific, it will help all corresponding departments and users clearly know when to switch in, what they need to do during the entire switch process, and what they should do or could not do in a particular step in the switch process.

### 1.3 Approach
In order to accomplish this project, we need to analyze the problem using Object-Oriented methodology. To be more specific, via following such method, we could write our problem statement, draw our use-case diagram and build our corresponding object model, dynamic model and so on. After the pre-works are completed, we then used Eclipse to build up our project via using Plug-in Swing.
